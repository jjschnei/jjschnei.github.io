					<h3>Kickstarter Campaign</h3>

					<p>Role:  Growth Engineer</p>

					<p>Stack:  JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Photoshop</p>

					<p>Sherlybox hired my company LaunchMachine to manage the marketing of their Kickstarter campaign.</p>
					<p>
					<p>
						As their growth engineer, I designed and built several landing pages to increase the number of backers as well as boost social media engagement of the project.
					</p>
					<p>
						The below 'Backer Boost' landing page, was designed to encourage the existing Kickstarter backers to refer their friends to the project.
