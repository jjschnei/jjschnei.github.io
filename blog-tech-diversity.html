        Technology jobs are disproportionally filled by whites, Asians and men.  While many tech companies have made it a public goal to diversity their workforce, there is still a long ways to go.  A recent <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/07/30/tech-companies-diveristy/">Fortune<a/> survey of 9 top tech companies found that on average women make up about one-third of the work force.
      </p><p>
        The lack of diversity in tech has been often justified as a pipeline issue:  there are more men who study computer science so there are more men in tech jobs.  However, an examination of the numbers reveals that isn’t always the case.  For example, 50% of introductory computer science students at Stanford and Berkeley are women.
      </p><p>
        While tech leaders have long pledged their support for diversity, the  makeup of tech companies is still lopsided.  Creating software is a highly creative enterprise. It’s not only morally right, but good business, to have diverse groups of people working together.
      </p><p>
        <h3>How Do We Fix the Issue?</h3>
        It's a step in the right direction that tech companies are starting to track and publish these statistics (what gets messured gets managed).  But there is more to be done. I believe that one of the ways to solve this problem is by providing universal early access to computers.  It’s critical that public schools have k-12 computer science (and AP computer science) courses.  This will make a big difference for future generations.  Right now, we need to make sure that the culture at tech companies is inclusive for women and all minority groups.
