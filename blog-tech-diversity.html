        Technology jobs are disproportionately filled by whites, Asians and men.  While many tech companies have made it a public goal to diversity their workforce, there is still a long ways to go.  A recent <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/07/30/tech-companies-diveristy/">Fortune<a/> survey of 9 top tech companies found that on average women make up about one-third of the work force.
      </p><p>
        The lack of diversity in tech has often been justified as a pipeline issue:  there are more men who study computer science so there are more men in tech jobs.  An examination of the numbers reveals that isn’t always the case.  For example, 50% of introductory computer science students at Stanford and Berkeley are women.  It is not merely a pipeline issue.

      <h3>Why it Matter</h3>
      <p>
        While tech leaders have long pledged their support for diversity, the  makeup of tech companies is still lopsided.  Creating software is a highly creative enterprise.  Equal employment opportunity for everyone is not only a moral obligation, it's also good business.  Having a broader and more diverse team will result in better ideas and products.
      </p>
      <h3>How We Fix the Issue</h3>
      <p>
        It's a step in the right direction that tech companies are starting to track and publish these statistics (what gets measured gets managed).  But there is more to be done. I believe that one of the ways to solve this problem is by providing universal early access to computers.  It’s critical that public schools have k-12 computer science (and AP computer science) courses.  This will make a big impact on future generations.  Right now, we need to make sure that the culture and hiring practices at tech companies are inclusive for women and all minority groups.
