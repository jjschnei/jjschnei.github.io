· What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
I learned a lot about padding, borders, and margins in this challenge.  I learned that it is called “the box model”.  It can be thought of boxes that wrap around a central piece of content.  This challenge reinforced the definition and relationships between each of the different parts:

Content - This is the content of an element, like text or an image.

Padding - This is the area around the content. The padding is transparent

Border - A box that goes around the padding and content.

Margin - A box outside the border. The margin is transparent

· What did you learn about CSS positioning?
I learned about the position property, which specifies the positioning on an element.  There are 4 main values associated to the position property: static, relative, fixed and absolute.  Here are their definitions.

Static – this is the default value and is not said to not be positioned.  It will be positioned according to the  normal flow of the page.

Relative – this is used to move an element in relation to where it would be in its default static position using top, right, bottom left.

Fixed – an element is fixed relative to viewpoint (i.e. it doesn’t move when you scroll).  As with relative position, it’s adjusted by top, right, bottom, and left.

Absolute – this behaves like fixed, but instead of being relative to the viewpoint, it’s fixed to the nearest positioned ancestor.


· What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
The easiest was the background image. The hardest was the nav bar.  It was particularly hard to get it centered.


· What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
I learned that CSS can be a bit frustrating for beginners.  My code kept growing as I attempted to get my page to look like the wire frame.  Eventually it became difficult to tell what was actually doing something.  Using the inspection tool helped remove unnecessary code.
