        <h3>What are the Benefits of Version Control?</h3>
        <p>
          Broadly speaking, version control is a system that keeps track of your changes and progress.  This is helpful because it allows you to revert to previous iterations of your work if you make a mistake.  Developers use version control to keep track of the changes in their code.  Submitting changes is usually batched and the process is called making a 'commit'.  Version control is especially helpful in collaborative environments.  A distributed team can work on the same project at the same time.  Team members will each make their own various commits.  These commits are reviwed and discussed by the team and then the multiple commits are combined in a process called merging.
        </p>
        <p>
          Developers use version control because it helps with team workflows.  As mentioned above, version control allows multiple people to work on the same code at the same time.  Version control tracks many aspects of the project such as who’s working on what, who makes which changes, when these changes were made, the content of the changes, and much more.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the most fundamental elements of version control is tracking changes. Tracking changes is important for several reasons.  For example, if you make a mistake, you can go back to a previous version of your code before you made the mistake. It also shows who made the changes and their notes about why they made them.  This is helpful when working on teams.  If you have a question about a particular block of code you can go back and ask the person who made it.
        </p>
        <h3>Git and GitHub</h3>
        <p>
          Git is a popular, open source version control system for software development.  Some of Git’s main benefits are its speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (i.e. large spread-out teams working on different parts of a project at the same time).  Git works as a repository with complete history and full version-tracking – all on your local computer.  You don’t need any network or central server to use Git.  As an open source project, you can enjoy all of Git's version control features for free.
        </p>
        <p>
          GitHub, provided by a company called GitLabs, is a website where you can upload and save your Git repositories. As a hosted service, GitHub provides a distributed version control system and source code management.  While Git is strictly a command line tool, GitHub has a GUI on its website.
        </p>
        <h3>Why Use GitHub?</h3>
        <p>
          GitHub stores your code “in the cloud”.  This makes it easy for distributed teams to work on the same project because they can access it from anywhere over the Internet.  This makes GitHub an ideal version control tool for both individuals and distributed teams.  In addition to hosted version control and source code management, GitHub also provides social networking functionality.  Users have profiles that can show their work and contributions.  Projects can be discussed publicly to maximize collaboration.
