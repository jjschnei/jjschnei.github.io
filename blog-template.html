##How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
My pair didn't show up for our session. I did the wireframe and HTML on my own.
##Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Yes, I think it's helpful to seperate design brainstorming from coding.  While they are obviously connected, they are two very different types of thinking for me.

##What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
I did a lot of research looking at other blogs.  I tried to draw inspiration from beautiful and simple blog desings.

##What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
I tired to incorporte as many as possible. I used <nav>, <header> and <article> tags.

My wireframe can be found in my github repo:  https://github.com/jjschnei/jjschnei.github.io

        Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
      </p><p>
        The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
