						Speakeasy Briefs is a menâ€™s apparel company initially launched on Kickstarter.  As the front-end developer, I designed and built the website.  Once completed, I used A/B split testing to optimize the user experience, which increased the conversion rate by over 70%.

					<p>
						I also implemented digital marketing campaigns utilizing several platforms including Facebook Ads, Google AdWords, Google Analytics, and Twitter Ads.

						Speakeasy Briefs was recognized as a "top selling merchant" on RedditGifts and was accepted into the Amazon Launchpad program.  Speakeasy Briefs has received national and local news coverage, including:  Forbes, NPR, FOX News, and the San Francisco Chronicle.
